04_Correlation and Experimental Design

===========Guess the correlation
On the right, use the scatterplot to estimate what the correlation is between 
the variables x and y. Once you've guessed it correctly, use the New Plot button 
to try out a few more scatterplots. When you're ready, answer the question 
below to continue to the next exercise.

Which of the following statements is NOT true about correlation?

Instructions

--If the correlation betwwen x and y has a high magnitude, the data points will
be clustered closely around a line.

--Correlation can be written as r.

--If x and y are negatively correlated, values of y decrease as values of x
increase

Answer: --- Correlation cannont be 0.


Spot on! When correlation is 0, that means there is no relationship between 
two variables and the points appear to be randomly scattered.

-----------Relationships between variables
In this chapter, you'll be working with a dataset world_happiness containing 
results from the 2019 World Happiness Report. The report scores various 
countries based on how happy people in that country are. It also ranks each 
country on various societal aspects such as social support, freedom, corruption, 
and others. The dataset also includes the GDP per capita and life expectancy for 
each country.

In this exercise, you'll examine the relationship between a country's life 
expectancy (life_exp) and happiness score (happiness_score) both visually and 
quantitatively. seaborn as sns, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and pandas as pd are 
loaded and world_happiness is available.

Instructions

Create a scatterplot of happiness_score vs. life_exp (without a trendline) 
using seaborn.

Show the plot.

# Create a scatterplot of happiness_score vs. life_exp and show
sns.scatterplot(x='life_exp' , y= 'happiness_score', data=world_happiness)

# Show plot
plt.show()

Create a scatterplot of happiness_score vs. life_exp with a linear trendline 
using seaborn, setting ci to None.

Show the plot.

# Create scatterplot of happiness_score vs life_exp with trendline
sns.lmplot(x= 'life_exp', y='happiness_score' , data=world_happiness , ci=None )

# Show plot
plt.show()

Question
--Based on the scatterplot, which is most likely the correlation between 
life_exp and happiness_score?

Answer: 0.8

Calculate the correlation between life_exp and happiness_score. 
Save this as cor.

# Create scatterplot of happiness_score vs life_exp with trendline
sns.lmplot(x='life_exp', y='happiness_score', data=world_happiness, ci=None)

# Show plot
plt.show()

# Correlation between life_exp and happiness_score
cor = world_happiness['life_exp'].corr(world_happiness['happiness_score'])

print(cor)

#msleep['sleep_total'].corr(msleep['sleep_rem'])

Vibrant visualizations! Scatterplots with trendlines are a great way 
to verify that a relationship between two variables is indeed linear.

=================What can't correlation measure?
While the correlation coefficient is a convenient way to quantify the strength 
of a relationship between two variables, it's far from perfect. In this 
exercise, you'll explore one of the caveats of the correlation coefficient by 
examining the relationship between a country's GDP per capita (gdp_per_cap) 
and happiness score.

pandas as pd, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and seaborn as sns are imported, and 
world_happiness is loaded.

Instructions

Create a seaborn scatterplot (without a trendline) showing the relationship 
between gdp_per_cap (on the x-axis) and life_exp (on the y-axis).

Show the plot

# Scatterplot of gdp_per_cap and life_exp
sns.scatterplot(x='gdp_per_cap', y='life_exp', data=world_happiness)

# Show plot
plt.show()

Calculate the correlation between gdp_per_cap and life_exp and store as cor.

# Scatterplot of gdp_per_cap and life_exp
sns.scatterplot(x='gdp_per_cap', y='life_exp', data=world_happiness)

# Show plot
plt.show()
  
# Correlation between gdp_per_cap and life_exp
cor = world_happiness['gdp_per_cap'].corr(world_happiness['life_exp'])

print(cor)

Question

The correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy is 0.7. Why is 
correlation not the best way to measure the relationship between these two 
variables?

Possible Answers
--Correlation measures how one variable affects another
Answer --- Correlation only measures linear relationships
--Correlation cannot properly measure relationships between numeric variables

Correct! The correlation coefficient can't account for any relationships 
that aren't linear, regardless of strength.

NB: Remember that a plot of a versus b means that a should be on the 
y-axis, and b should be on the x-axis.

==============Transforming variables
When variables have skewed distributions, they often require a transformation 
in order to form a linear relationship with another variable so that 
correlation can be computed. In this exercise, you'll perform a transformation 
yourself.

pandas as pd, numpy as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and seaborn as sns are 
imported, and world_happiness is loaded.

Instructions

Create a scatterplot of happiness_score versus gdp_per_cap and calculate 
the correlation between them.

# Scatterplot of happiness_score vs. gdp_per_cap
sns.scatterplot(x='gdp_per_cap', y='happiness_score', data=world_happiness)
plt.show()

# Calculate correlation
cor = world_happiness['happiness_score'].corr(world_happiness['gdp_per_cap'])
print(cor)

Add a new column to world_happiness called log_gdp_per_cap that contains the 
log of gdp_per_cap.
Create a seaborn scatterplot of happiness_score versus log_gdp_per_cap.
Calculate the correlation between log_gdp_per_cap and happiness_score.

# Create log_gdp_per_cap column
world_happiness['log_gdp_per_cap'] = np.log(world_happiness['gdp_per_cap'])

# Scatterplot of happiness_score vs. log_gdp_per_cap
sns.scatterplot(x='log_gdp_per_cap', y='happiness_score', data=world_happiness)
plt.show()

# Calculate correlation
cor = world_happiness['log_gdp_per_cap'].corr(world_happiness['happiness_score'])
print(cor)

Terrific transforming! The relationship between GDP per capita and happiness 
became more linear by applying a log transformation. Log transformations are 
great to use on variables with a skewed distribution, such as GDP.

===============Does sugar improve happiness?
A new column has been added to world_happiness called grams_sugar_per_day, 
which contains the average amount of sugar eaten per person per day in each 
country. In this exercise, you'll examine the effect of a country's average 
sugar consumption on its happiness score.

pandas as pd, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and seaborn as sns are imported, and 
world_happiness is loaded.

Instructions

Create a seaborn scatterplot showing the relationship between 
grams_sugar_per_day (on the x-axis) and happiness_score (on the y-axis).

Calculate the correlation between grams_sugar_per_day and happiness_score.

# Scatterplot of grams_sugar_per_day and happiness_score
sns.scatterplot(x='grams_sugar_per_day', y='happiness_score', data=world_happiness)
plt.show()

# Correlation between grams_sugar_per_day and happiness_score
cor = world_happiness['grams_sugar_per_day'].corr(world_happiness['happiness_score'])
print(cor)

Question
Based on this data, which statement about sugar consumption and happiness 
scores is true?

Answer: 
--Increased sugar consumption is associated with a higher happiness score.

Nice interpretation of correlation! If correlation always implied that one 
thing causes another, people may do some nonsensical things, like eat more 
sugar to be happier.

================Confounders
A study is investigating the relationship between neighborhood residence and 
lung capacity. Researchers measure the lung capacity of thirty people from 
neighborhood A, which is located near a highway, and thirty people from 
neighborhood B, which is not near a highway. Both groups have similar 
smoking habits and a similar gender breakdown.

Which of the following could be a confounder in this study?

Answer: Air pollution


Correct! You would expect there to be more air pollution in the 
neighborhood situated near the highway, which can cause lower lung capacity.

================Study types
While controlled experiments are ideal, many situations and research questions 
are not conducive to a controlled experiment. In a controlled experiment, 
causation can likely be inferred if the control and test groups have similar 
characteristics and don't have any systematic difference between them. On the 
other hand, causation cannot usually be inferred from observational studies, 
whose results are often misinterpreted as a result.

In this exercise, you'll practice distinguishing controlled experiments from 
observational studies.

Determine if each study is a controlled experiment or observational study.

Controlled experiment
--Subjects are randomly assigned to a diet and weight loss is compared.
--Purchasing rates are compared between users of an e-commerce site who are
randomly directed to a new version of the home page or an old version.
--Asthma symptoms are compared between children randomly assigned to receive
professional home pest managment services or pest management education.

Observational Study
--A week ago, the home page of an e-commerce site was updated. Purchasing rates
are compared between users who saw the old and new home page versions.

--Prevalence of heart disease is compared between veterans with PTSD and 
verterans without PTSD.


Marvelous matching! Now that you can distinguish between controlled 
experiments and observational studies, you'll be able to tell when an 
observational study claims to esablish a causal relationship.

===============Longitudinal vs. cross-sectional studies
A company manufactures thermometers, and they want to study the relationship 
between a thermometer's age and its accuracy. To do this, they take a sample 
of 100 different thermometers of different ages and test how accurate they are.
 Is this data longitudinal or cross-sectional?

Answer: Cross-sectional

Perfect! This is a cross-sectional study since researchers aren't following 
the same set of thermometers over time and repeatedly measuring their accuracy 
at different ages.
